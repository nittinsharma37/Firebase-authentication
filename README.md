# Firebase-authentication

This project is an example of Firebase authentication in a Flutter.
This project shows how to implement a full authentication flow in Flutter using Email/Password and Google authentication.

It aims to be a reference implementation. Think of it as "authentication done right".

## Project goals
This project shows how to:

- Sign up with an email and password
- Sign in with that email and password
- Verify email
- Reset password
- Sign up with Google authentication
- Sign in with Google authentication
- Use appropriate state management techniques to separate UI, logic, and Firebase authentication code
- Handle errors and present user-friendly error messages
- Write production-ready code following best practices

Feel free to use this in your own projects. üòâ

NOTE: This project will be kept up to date with the latest packages and Flutter version.

## Configuring your project
- After getting a project from GitHub run `flutter pub upgrade` to get latest dependencies
- Next run `flutterfire configure` to create `firebase` project and associate your Flutter app with Firebase project. This will also add `google-services.json` and `firebase-options.dart` files to your project. If you haven't configured Firebase before follow these [instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android) to configure Firebase SDK. Note that there are a lot of problems with stand alone installation on Windows, you are better off using `npm` approach even though it is a little more diffcult to configure
- For Google authentication you have to add your [SHA certificate fingerprint](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/9137403?hl=en) to your project in Firebase console. In dev, use below command to get your dev certificate fingerprints (SHA1 and SHA256) and paste them into Firebase console undr project settings:
`keytool -list -v -keystore "C:\Users\YourUserName\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android`
- In `Firebase Console` add Authentication to your project ad enable email/password authentication. Also, add another provider and configure Google authentication method. Run `flutterfire configure` again (you have to do this after making changes in the console)
