# Firebase-authentication

This project is an example of Firebase authentication in a flutter.
This project shows how to implement a full authentication flow in Flutter, using sign Up with email and password, sign in with email and password, and reset password.

It aims to be a reference implementation. Think of it as "authentication done right".

## Project goals
This project shows how to:

- Sign up with an email and password
- Sign in with that email and password
- Verify email
- Reset password
- Sign up with Google authentication
- Sign in with Google authentication
- Use appropriate state management techniques to separate UI, logic, and Firebase authentication code
- Handle errors and present user-friendly error messages
- Write production-ready code following best practices

Feel free to use this in your own projects. 😉
